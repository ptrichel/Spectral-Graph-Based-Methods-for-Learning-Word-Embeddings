# Spectral-Graph-Based-Methods-for-Learning-Word-Embeddings
Python implementation of recent graph-based approaches to learn word embeddings from word co-occurrence graphs:
Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding and Laplacian Eigenmaps.

Those implementations are part of a project realized by Paul TRICHELAIR and Souhail TOUMDI at ENS Paris Saclay. The project aims at comparing spectral graph based method to state of the art methods 
to learn word embeddings.
A qualitative evaluation of the embeddings generated using those methods can be found in the report. 

The evaluation shows promising results for locally linear embeddings.
